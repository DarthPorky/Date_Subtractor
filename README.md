Software Engineers have never been known for their creativity in naming products. Look at Bill Gates he nearly named the famous Windows operating system "Interface Manager".

***WHAT IT DOES***

Moving on, this is an App developed with JavaScript that accepts two dates and outputs the difference between them in days.

***WHY WAS IT DEVELOPED***

I don't know about you but I usually find myself, trying to calculate how many days have passed between dates, mostly when looking at instagram posts.

***FUTURE FEATURES***
  - Allow one to choose wether output to be in months, years or a combination.
  - An API endpoint because why not.
  - An android version (Can't let them React Native skills go to waste).
